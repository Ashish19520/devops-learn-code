### Archeticture of kubernets

1-one worker node that contains your container ->
2-pod that is a abstraction on container ->they can contain multiple containers but the one is at least the can
3-and proxy that is an abstraction on pod that contains inbound and outbound traffic

and you can contaner scaling if ypur application is going big

to contro all the worker nodes like auto scalling removing run and restart

there is a master node whict is on top of all these
master node contain various component which help with managing theworker nodes

together all they form a cluster

see the picture kubernets-worker-node for understand worker
