step one->create a filename with  dockerfile
touch dockerfile

FROM node : latest
COPY ..
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node","index.js"]



for creating a build in docker use 

docker build -t basic-app .


ignoring the file 
use .dockerignore to ignore the files

example entry of .dockerignore->dummy.txt
				 node-module
				 .txt   ->this will ignore all files with .txt extension
				 
				 
delete operation from command lines for image and container

docker image rm basic-app 
docker container rm basic -app -f
use -f for force delete if image is used by some container

docker image rm basic-app -f

also we can delete it from docker-desktop


docker system prune -a   -> this will delete all the versions and contaners

docker build -t basic-app:v2   -> this will add a tag of v2 in front of basic-app img -> also known as vesioning

command to run docker from terminal

docker run --name basic-app-v2 -p 3000:3000 basic-app:v2 
	
	
with help of volumes if we change something in our project that will automatically reflects on the container

FROM node : latest
RUN npm install -g nodemon
WORKDIR /app
COPY ..
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm","run","dev"]

docker run --name basic-container -p 3000:3000 --rm -v /Users/ashish/desktop/gsmarena/basic-app:/app basic-app   this will create a build with volume that will reflect changes on every single edit

to create a set of instructions we need a yaml file when our code base grow and we have a lot of commands to run so we create a compose.yaml file


services:
	img:
		build: .
		container_name: basic-container
		ports:- 5500:5500

docker hub-> it is the world largest library and community for docker images
we can create a repository here like in github and push our build image and use it anywhere across the globe
after signin up u get a link and to push like
docker push anilsidhu/node-yt-app:tagname 


use ->docker images to get all images in ur system

step-1->first login on browser and in terminal run command 
docker login-> this will login on docker hub in ur system or use command search on web with loginid and passowrd use stackoverflow

if you see error of storing credintioal 
echo '{"credsStore":"desktop"}' > ~/.docker/config.json

docker login --username ashish19520


docker push anilsidhu/node-yt-app-> this will push the code in docker repo
docker pull anilsidhu/node-yt-app  -> use this command to pull from docker hub
