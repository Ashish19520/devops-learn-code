docker run -it node   ->this will open an interactive mode for us or nodejs temrinal
images take a snap of existing code and it is a read only


images are layers based and only that layers are run which ypu change
and if one layer changes all subsequent layers get executed


Attached and deattached container

when we restart a container the process is deattached in command line
but when we start the container first it run in attached mode to the command line

use -d to run in detached mode while creating a new image

suppose we have to input something from terminal if we run this in deattached mode we face error 
suppose taking two numbers from user and show the sum 

so we use -it interactive terminal mode
also use  -a means attached mode

you can add -rm command while running the container and this wiol automatically remove the container when container goes down

docker run -p 3000:80 -d -rm hello-node

copy command allows you to add or extract something from a running or stop container to local machine

#########   docker cp dummy/hello.txt  my-node-app:/hello   

above is the docker copy command that take source and destination and copy source to destination folder and rate a new one if folder does't exist
without restart or stop the container

### tags ####

docker run -p 3000:80 -d -rm --name hello-node-container -> this will add a tag to container hello -node container

for images it is break in two a name and a tag
ex-> node:18
    node:latest
    here node is a name of repository and 18,latest alpine all are tags
    that means a repository can have multiple images

    to create use

######  docker built -t node-app/todolist
