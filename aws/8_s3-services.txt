simple storage service

go to s3 bucket create a bucket with a unique name

store data as objects
region specific
each element store as a key value pair 
each object within a bucket is stored as a key value pair


we can also make the dynamic links to serve html or any file publically thrugh a url

just go on permissions and remove blockage
and in properties add enable the static url

#### s3 bucket policies ###3
json based access control policies that u attach directly to an S3 bucket to manage
permissions for accessing the bucket and its objects

they allow u to define who can accesss the data and what actions they can perform such asread
write or delete enabling fine -grained control over the security of ur data stored in s3


use aws policy generator to generate a policy
u get something like this

{
  "Id": "Policy1746623475003",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1746623470350",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ashish-bucket-19520/*",
      "Principal": "*"
    }
  ]
}

it automatic provides the version and use latest file like index1
                                                            index 2
                                                            index 3 
                                                            it uses versioning like this and if we delete a version file the second latest will take the place
