ELB-> elastic Load Balancing

scalability-> vertical, horizontal.

availability-> less downtime so website is highly accessable to the users


elasticity->elasticity means the ability to automatically adjust resources as the demand changes
adding more  when needed and removing when its no longer available

ex-ASG -> auto scaling group

we launch two instance and on left sidebar of ec2 there is load Balancing and choose load balancer




###### Auto scaling Group ########
ASG
it is a service that automatically add or delete ec2 instance based on load and traffic

scaleup when more capacity is needed and down when capacity is less

replace unhealthy instance automatically to ensure relaibility

u can set rules for scaling based on cpu usage or request count
