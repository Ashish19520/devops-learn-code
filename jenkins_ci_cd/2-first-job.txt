we create a new job
by adding job and 
run on the script shell 

echo "hello world"

to execute a command in the container

we first create a file with .sh extension 
see the file ->script.sh

then we copy it to the container
#-->docker cp script.sh jenkins:/tmp/script.sh

then we open the container that run nginx
#-->docker exec -it jenkins bash


and execute the command with thi
#-->/tmp/script.sh

# use this if the script show some permissin issue
chmod +x script.sh
