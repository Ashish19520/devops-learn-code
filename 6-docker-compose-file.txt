                     volumes                          Networks

in yaml file we don;t need to create a network it automatically create the netowek for us and add all network in that newly
created Network

but u can also create network but then yaml does't crreate the network for us
## also install the docker compose un ur linux


########### starting the servicees with yaml ##########

use 
#->>## docker-compose up
        docker-compose up -d  ###run in deattac mode 
        docker-compose down   ###  this delates all containe and netwrok but don't delete volume to remove volume also add -v
        docker-compose down -v
