docker volumes allowed us to share data that could be a file or folder b/w host and container
and also b/w containers


docker run --name static-content -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d -p 8080:80 nginx
 this command creates a contaier of nginx with name static-content that serves the index.html file present in the pwd and map to nginx static website
 and if you change the index file the component will mounted automatic which is defult behaviour of nginx.



 docker exec -it static-content  - > this command open the container in an interactive mode
