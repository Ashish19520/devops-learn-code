it is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containarized applications

we can not use cloud provide container manamgement tool like
ECS in aws because we are getting locked into the service

so here kubernetes cam into picture

it is an open source system for
orchestrating container deployments

k8 help us in monitoring
1->automatic deployments
2->Scanling and load balancing
3->Management
it can be used any cloud proider

### Archeticture of kubernets

1-one worker node that contains your container ->
2-pod that is a abstraction on container ->they can contain multiple containers but the one is at least the can
3-and proxy that is an abstraction on pod that contains inbound and outbound traffic

and you can contaner scaling if ypur application is going big

to contro all the worker nodes like auto scalling removing run and restart

there is a master node whict is on top of all these
master node contain various component which help with managing theworker nodes

together all they form a cluster

see the picture kubernets-worker-node for understand worker

 ####  installation ###########


 we are going to install minikube  which give usa playground to play with k8
 and kubectrl

 minikube documentation->>  https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download

 step 1->sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube && rm minikube-linux-amd64


 see the documentation now install kubectl 

    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
