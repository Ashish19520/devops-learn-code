installing mysql

1. Initial Permission Issues
You first tried to install packages as a regular user (admin1) without sudo, which caused permission errors. You correctly switched to root with sudo -i.

2. MySQL Installation Problems
The apt upgrade revealed issues with MySQL:

bash
Copy
# Remove problematic MySQL packages

apt purge mysql-server mysql-server-8.0
apt autoremove

# Clean up any remaining files

rm -rf /var/lib/mysql
rm -rf /etc/mysql

# Then reinstall MySQL if needed

apt update
apt install mysql-server -y
apt install nginx -y

bash
Copy
# Fix broken packages
apt --fix-broken install

# Clean package cache
apt clean
apt update
