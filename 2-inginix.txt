apache and nginix are same apache used to host php while nginix used to host web packages
 NGINX is an open-source web server software that's also used as
  a reverse proxy,
  load balancer, 
  and HTTP cache,
   known for its high performance and efficient resource utilization, 
   especially for handling static content and high traffic volumes. 


installing nginix;

1->sudo apt-get update -y
2->sudo apt get-install nginx -y 
3->systemctl status nginx   #used to check status of nginx
4->systemctl start nginx  #to start the nginx
5->systemctl stop nginx ->to stop the process


to check nginx configuration

also if you stuck and not able to start nginx
The error shows that port 80 (HTTP) is already being used by another service, preventing Nginx from starting. Here's how to fix it:

sudo lsof -i :80
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :80

Step 2: Stop the Conflicting Service  ####
If Apache is running:

sudo systemctl stop apache2

If another Nginx instance is running:  #####

sudo systemctl stop nginx

If an unknown process is using port 80 (use the PID from Step 1): #####

sudo kill -9 <PID>

Step 3: Start Nginx Again   ####

sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx  # Verify it's running


##to see the configurations of nginx


cd /etc/nginx/



ifconfig
docker0: 172.17.0.1  ->default ip for docker
eno1: ethernet ips 

lo: LOOPBACK,RUNNING
       127.0.0.1  locahost for internal configuration

wlp59s0: 
        192.168.2.173  ip assign by router for broadcasting on same network if docker is stop and on docker default we saw apache2 it is because
 
docker used apache to to show nginx home page use localhost default port


in sites-enabled there is a default file we can change the default path and assign a new one

cd /home/admin1/devops->nano devops write config.

then in cd /etc/nginx  nginx.conf in below path add line  include/home/admin1/devops/*  

and to link devops to site-config so if somone change the devops file then automaticitreflects tosited-enabled use on devops folder

sudo ln -s /home/admin1/devops/devops /etc/nginx/sites-available


basically what we do is we create a file on 
location cd /home/admin1/devops/devops
which store address of cd /var/html/htmlfile
we change some html 
and we set this route in nginx.conf file 
sudo ln -s /home/admin1/devops/devops /etc/nginx/sites-available
run this command then run test
we remove the sites-enabled default folder
and site-availablethe html  enabled default folder which store the address of  so asically we link a new file 

html->linked-old->nginx.conf   to html->linked-new-html->nginx.conf


or how to do a reverse-proxy
how to redirect  a port url to diferen port like localhost/3000 to port 80 of nginx

nginix -t  ############# to run test cases

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # SSL configuration
        #
        # listen 443 ssl default_server;
        # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
        #
        # Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
        #
        # Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
        #
        # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
        # Don't use them in a production server!
        #
        # include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

        root /var/www/html;

        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

we edit above to like below not full sut some parts

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        server_name _;

        location / {     
                     root /home/admin1/Desktop/mylearn;    ->>root location of folde
                     index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
                     proxy_pass "http://localhost:3000"     -->proxy pass to local host 3000

        }
}

so now 80 is redirect to locahost:3000
